1. Regarding the Abortion line: the use of absolute numbers rather than a proportion (such as x per 1,000 or y% of woman aged z) is misleading when done in a country where the population grows each year.  This can likely be classified as hiding relevant data. Giving absolute numbers is just not as relevant as proportional data. The later could give a completely different picture as to the trend in abortions between these time periods. Here there is likely an agenda to persuade the viewer that abortions are becoming more common in the US. Although this is true in terms of total number of abortions, it may be the case that a smaller proportion of women are getting abortions.

2. Regarding the Abortion line: a more obvious issue with the graph is how steep the slope of the line is.  When we look at the numbers of abortions in 2006 and 2013 we see that the number has hardly increased much, yet the chart makes it look like its increased tremendously.  It is clear that the two lines are not drawn to scale. This is an example of using graphic forms in inappropriate ways. Here the intent is for the viewer to get the impression that abortions (negative connotation) is increasing rapidly while Cancer Screening and Prevention Services (positive connotation) is decreasing just as quickly (both are obviously inaccurate when you look at the numbers provided).

Extra:
  There are many other misleading elements to this graphic. Such as:
      The use of arrows points on the right most points of the lines.
      The use of linear lines.. what is the likelihood that the data fits so neatly onto a straight line?
      The aggregation of all abortions across all "reasons for requesting abortion". There may have been a change in why women are getting     
         abortions that are morally interesting/relevant.
      etc.
